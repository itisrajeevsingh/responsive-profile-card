## 🧠 Interview Questions & Answers

### How did you make it responsive?
Used a mobile-first approach with flexible widths and max-width constraints combined with Flexbox for layout alignment.

### Which layout system did you use and why?
Flexbox was used for vertical and horizontal centering because the layout is one-dimensional and straightforward.

### How would you convert this into a reusable component?
In React, I would create a reusable `ProfileCard` component and pass profile data as props for scalability.
